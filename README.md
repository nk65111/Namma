### About Project
RAAHI APP allows you to schedule for a week or month and set the timing. When you use the RAAHI APP, we handle everything and provide you with your driver details 30 minutes before the pickup time. We will send the driver to your home at the appointed time. You get a smart batching system with Raahi APP. As a result, every time you schedule, it batches people who are heading in the same direction together. This will reduce costs for passengers and benefits the driver in terms of earning, time and fuel usage. This helps to ensure that each driver is able to pick up multiple passengers in a single trip, as opposed to making multiple trips to pick up single passengers. This increases efficiency, reduces the time and fuel costs for the driver, and also helps to reduce the cost of the ride for the passengers, making it more affordable.

Using the used algorithm, we are able to optimize the full capacity of cabs. Assembling batches in real-time to meet demand.  This helps to reduce congestion on the roads and the cost of running a cab service. The technology also helps to make the most efficient use of resources and reduce emissions. Ultimately, this makes the service more sustainable and cost-effective for all involved. This in turn leads to happier customers, who can rely on the cab service to always be available and arrive on time. The increased efficiency also leads to increased profits for the cab service. Ultimately, this technology ensures that everyone benefits.

RAAHI APP has an e-wallet where users can add money at once and the wallet will deduct this amount after each ride, create an invoice for the passenger, and directly transfer the amount to the driver's account by calculating the reduced cost for each passenger. The app also allows users to pay through debit/credit cards, net banking and UPI. Additionally, users can also avail discounts and special offers through the app. The app also provides customers with 24/7 customer support, so they can get help whenever they need it. Furthermore, all transactions are secure and protected with advanced encryption technology. Finally, RAAHI APP also provides detailed analytics to help users keep track of their spending.
